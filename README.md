# IntentSwap-Prototype
A prototype for an intent-centric application
IntentSwap - Hassle-Free Trading

1. The Problem IntentSwap Solves:

In the current DeFi space, users often have to:

• Search for the best exchange (DEX).

• Compare rates and fees.

• Calculate slippage.

• Perform multiple manual steps for complex transactions (e.g., cross-chain swaps).

• Worry about MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) or front-running attacks.

IntentSwap removes this complexity by allowing users to simply state their intent.

2. Core Intent:

Users don't need to specify "Please swap 1 ETH on Uniswap V3 for USDC with 0.5% slippage."

Instead, they can simply say: "I want to swap 1 ETH for USDC at the best possible price."

3. Architecture and workflow:

• Step 1: User declares Intent:

• User enters IntentSwap UI/DApp: "Swap 1 ETH for USDC." (Or more complex Intents like: "Swap 1 ETH for USDC, then use that USDC to buy NFT X on OpenSea.")

• They can also add optional constraints: "I want to complete the transaction within 10 minutes" or "I don't want to pay more than $5 in gas fees."

• Example UI:

• "I want to exchange" field: [1 ETH]

• "Get" field: [USDC]

• Advanced options: [Max Gas Fee: $5], [Deadline: 10 mins]

• Step 2: Intent Matching & Solver Network:

• The user's Intent is sent to a decentralized network of "Solvers".

• These Solvers are entities (bots, or even people) that compete to find the best way to fulfill the Intent. They have access to real-time market data (DEX rates, cross-chain bridges, NFT markets, etc.).

• Each Solver proposes a “Solution” – a series of on-chain transactions to fulfill the user’s Intent (e.g., ETH -> WETH on Uniswap V2, WETH -> USDC on Curve, all in one bundle transaction).

• Differentiation: Solvers don’t just search for one DEX, but can search across hundreds of DEXs, bridges, and even lending/borrowing protocols to find the most efficient path, even performing arbitrage to bring the best return to the user.

• Step 3: Verify and Select a Solution:

• The IntentSwap DApp displays Solutions from different Solvers to the user, including details (amount of USDC received, estimated gas fee, completion time).

• The user can choose the best solution (usually the default) or let the system automatically select the most optimal solution based on the initial constraints.

• UI: List of “Proposed Solutions”, with “Best Solution” highlighted.

• Step 4: Execute the transaction:

• When a user accepts a Solution, the transaction is executed on-chain. This can be done via an atomic transaction bundle to ensure that all steps of the Intent are completed or none at all.

• Solvers can be rewarded with a small fee for finding a solution (which can be built into the swap price or paid separately).
